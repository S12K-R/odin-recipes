    <h5> Is french toast actually French?</h5>
    
    <p>French toast (pain perdu in French) isn't actually from France. Legend has it that
        a man named Joseph French from the U.S. created the sweet breakfast dish in 1724
        and named it after himself. However, that's probably not true: People were frying
        milk- and egg-soaked bread in Ancient Rome, according to early recipes.</p> 

    <p>It's more likely that modern French toast was invented by 15th-century cooks who were
        on a mission to use up stale bread.</p>
